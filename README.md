# Docker Practice Repository

Welcome to the Docker Practice Repository! This repository is intended to help you get hands-on experience with Docker, a powerful tool for containerizing applications and managing containerized environments. Whether you are new to Docker or looking to refine your skills, this repository provides practical exercises and examples to help you master Docker.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Docker**: Follow the [official Docker installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) to install Docker Engine and Docker Compose on your machine.
- **Git**: Ensure Git is installed to clone the repository. Download it from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/docker-practice.git
   cd docker-practice
   ```

2. **Explore the Repository Structure**

   The repository is organized into several key directories:

   - `dockerfiles/`: Contains Dockerfiles for various practice scenarios.
   - `compose/`: Contains Docker Compose files for multi-container setups.
   - `scripts/`: Utility scripts to assist with Docker commands and setups.

3. **Build and Run Docker Containers**

   Navigate to the appropriate folder based on what you want to practice. Use the following commands to build and run Docker containers:

   - **To build a Docker image**:

     ```bash
     docker build -t my-practice-image path/to/dockerfile
     ```

   - **To run a Docker container**:

     ```bash
     docker run -d -p 8080:80 my-practice-image
     ```

   - **To use Docker Compose to start a multi-container application**:

     ```bash
     docker-compose up
     ```

4. **Verify the Setup**

   - **Check Running Containers**:

     ```bash
     docker ps
     ```

   - **Access Your Application**: If your container exposes ports, you can access your application via `http://localhost:8080` (or the port you specified).

## Practice Exercises

These exercises will help you become proficient in Docker:

1. **Basic Dockerfile Creation**: Write a Dockerfile for a simple web application (e.g., a static site using Nginx). Build and run the container.

2. **Multi-Stage Builds**: Use a multi-stage Dockerfile to build a minimal production image for a Node.js application.

3. **Docker Compose Setup**: Create a Docker Compose file for a simple application stack that includes a web server and a database.

4. **Networking**: Experiment with Docker networking by connecting multiple containers on a custom network and accessing them from another container.

5. **Volumes**: Implement Docker volumes to persist data for a containerized MySQL database and ensure data is not lost when the container restarts.

6. **Environment Variables**: Pass environment variables to containers and use them in your applications. Create a `.env` file for Docker Compose.

7. **Health Checks**: Add health checks to your Docker containers to ensure they are running correctly and automatically restart if they fail.

8. **Docker Swarm**: Set up a Docker Swarm cluster and deploy a service to demonstrate basic orchestration.
